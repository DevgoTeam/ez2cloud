EZ2Cloud Software Documentation EZ2Cloud is a cloud-based software, developed by DevGo, to provide an inventory and classification solution upon the file structure of an on-premise network shared folder. The goal is to automate a meta data extraction procedure to be used as input of a migration process from one file server to another. The software support different migrations aproach but mainly EZ2Cloud provides all you need to migrate from a on-premise service to a server based in a cloud plaform. Here you will find all Software documentation and detailed information on use and configuration required. The software main goal is to provide support tools to be used on File Servers data migration process. With all the features allowing organize, classify and labeling file serves network shares contents based on the metadata for files and folders this is the better option to move on-premise servers contents to a cloud service in fast, reliable, secure and with minimum workload effort. Overview We want to deliver support tools that allow a smooth transition between on-premises network file servers to cloud. The main issue with this transition on most companies is using the current available automation tools to copy data volumes still needs a lot of human and hands tasks. We aim to bring to the mininum as possible the needed task and let the automation tools works as smooth as possible. Most tools used for data copy must have the input in a specific format, but theirs is no means that allows one to create an underlined structured of the data from a company organization view, identify orphan data or set data ownership in an end-user friendly approach. EZ2Cloud was designed and implemented to address these issues. It is possible to export from EZ2Cloud a file formatted and ready to be used by an automation process with the minimum human intervention. Different from existing solutions on this, EZ2Cloud will allow you to include metadata and so set a clear and concise view of structure, ownership and custom labels you want to apply to a shared network data on a file server. All the configurations tasks, settings definitions, customizations and requirements to complete before running E2Cloud on your company will be the content of the following sections.

Overview The functionalities and features you will find on these pages are related with the main goal of EZ2Cloud: provides a colaborative and distribuited platform that allows you define and apply all the elements required on a migration job from on server to another or from an on-premise server to a cloud service. To achieve this goal, EZ2Cloud relies in gathering data and produce information related with metada from files and folders located on a server network shared folder. Specifically the data that will be gatther from the users that actually works with the file servers contents in a distrubted and colaborative approach. The metadata gather from server will be mapped to entities representing files and folders on EZ2Cloud, allowing each user to apply to files amd folders some labels. To sum up the platform will presents the users some file and let them assign labels, owners and with all the data gather and processed later on an authorized user can create and export a file with items that will be the source data for the migration.

If you want to, please refer to Entities and Concepts where you can find more details about EZ2Cloud [Entities and Concepts Details](.Essentials/Concepts/index.md) used on this Guide. Overview EZ2Cloud provides a Collaborative work approach to allow users from a company business unit to enhance information on a shared network folder content. The enhanced information is representing as semantic label or ownership label. So EZ2Cloud will work with the metadata gathered from a File Server and upon that users can add Semantic Labels and Ownership Labels accordingly the real usage of the File Server at a given time. This approach will work with Projects, Labels, Users, Satellite Service and other components that a user with an Administrator Role must first setting and configuring for company. EZ2Cloud Dashboard Here any user with the Administrator Role have an overview of the main Tenant area in EZ2Cloud. Namely information about Tenant identification, Projects that has been created and information about users, labels, Sattelite server and their status. Also it will be shown the current data related with which plan the Tenant has. If the Tenant has a non free plan, it is also shown information about the payment. Initial Configurations The configuration needed to be done in order to allow users to access the EZ2Cloud started after a Tenant is created. To see more details on how to create a Tenant please refer to Create Tenant The actual configuration will begin by creating and defining all information that will be used to represents EZ2Cloud users, users roles, labels, projects and other EZ2Cloud entities and concepts. So refer to the next link to specifics of each information item: User Managment Find here all the detils related with User Managment functionalities. Create, Remove, Disable, Create multiple users from CSV files. Managing Users Roles and Configure and Setup Third-party Authentication. Theese are a summary of the main features and in order to have your users ready to use EZ2Cloud. Satelite Servers Following the initial Tenant configuration process, it is necessary to create the data elements for later use and installation of a Sattelite Server. Labels EZ2Cloud users will be using Semantic Labels or just Labels to tag folder and files. These Semantic Labels are defined in the specific context of an organization, department or bussiness unit as a requirment for each project when configure labels that can be used. The labels are related to a Tenant's organizational and work context so they must be created and configured optinally in multiple languages and refering to terms that represent Tenant's business entities, concepts, and data. Projects The main unit of information is a project.

Let's look at the roles in a little more detail: Administrator - Users with this role has access to all features and functionalities. Can configure all the data required for a Tenant. Can change settings that impact all the Tenant users. Recommended for people who, in the context of a EZ2Cloud need full access to configure and setup the Tenant artifacts including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting data. Project Admnistrator - Users with this role can manage project. Create, Change settings, Archive, Setup and install Sattelite Service. Label Administrator - Users with this role will be responsible to manage the Labels. As the ownership labels are created from the user name the major concern of the users with this role is to actual manage the semantic labels. User - Users will be able to work at the colaborative working area from the End-user view. These are the predefined roles the ones that can be used to assign one or more roles to each user. However, this is a task that can only be performed by a user with the role of Administrator. Normally the give user one or more roles it is done when the user is being created.
